My main tasks in this project was the menu as well as the displaying of different informations, selfteaching and tasks, for the user. \\
At the beginning I created a shared Unity project and added the Steam VR plug-in. I created different rooms for the testing of the close and far range interactions. Also I designed the learning room, described in \ref{sec:Learningroom}. With V. Brockmeyer I discussed the structure of the supermarket. Additional I researched the options to switch between the rooms and created the basis for the script \textit{TargetTest.cs}.\\
After the creation of the basic scenes I researched for a solution of an radial menu on the controller. I implemented this with the ``VRTK'' plug-in. To collect all functions behind the buttons in one script I created the script \textit{menu.cs}.
As soon as all interactions were implemented L. Anger and I integrated the interactions in the menu and all scenes. Here I helped to simplify the switching between different interactions with a ray. \\
In the last weeks I implemented the selfteaching together with V. Brockmeyer. This was time-consuming because the counter has to be increased or set on different parts of the project and the height of the canvas has to be set for every step.\\
With the knowledge of the selfteaching I and L. Anger implemented also the tasks in the supermarket. Here we had to add a board on the wall and to short the actual tasks texts. \\
Also I did the test surveys together with L. Anger.\\

\textbf{Self-Reflexion:}\\ \\
In my opinion the project ran quiet well. Everybody had their part of the project and we also helped each other.\\
I underestimated some parts of my responsibilities. First the selfteaching took much more time than I expected. There were a lot more steps to do than I thought. Second the combination of all interactions in one menu and scene was more complicated. We did not think about that they could affect each other or that parts of the interaction have to be loaded at the start of the scene to work correctly.\\

\textbf{Responsibilities:}\\ \\
Besides mandatory tasks, like for example doing research on specific problems and helping with the project management, I was mainly working on the implementation of the interactions. At the beginning of the project we divided the interactions into CR and FR (compare section~\ref{sec:Interactions}). At that time I became responsible for the FR methods of the \textit{Interaction Lab}. As it turned out it was not wise to distinguish between those two categories strictly, the borders of the jurisdiction of B. Boerner (Head of CR interactions) and me became more and more blurred. That is why we ended up working on most of the interaction methods together. This was more expedient, because for example the \textit{Wand Grab} (compare section~\ref{sec:WandGrab}), which is a CR interaction is very similar to the FR interactions \textit{Raycast} (compare section~\ref{sec:Raycast}) and \textit{Extendable Raycast} (compare section~\ref{sec:ExtendableRay}). Because B: Boerner went into holidays rather at the end of the implementation phase, I implemented the \textit{Wand Grab} on my own. \\
Together with A. Bolder I integrated the implemented interaction methods into the actual scenes (compare section~\ref{sec:VRLabor}) of the \textit{Interaction Lab}. We also took care of the visualisation of the tasks for the user. Therefore we created a display on the wall of the supermarket as well as next to the controller. On both of the displays the corresponding tasks are presented for the user. \\
I was also involved in creating the project video and all images for this documentation.\\
A. Bolder and I ran a test survey with 5 participants, which is described in section \textcolor{red}{???}.

\textbf{Self-Reflexion:}\\ \\
All in all I felt like the project run smoothly and well planned. Of course I was confronted with unknown terrain, as I never had implemented interactions of any kind. Maybe this was why I first started to create one script per interaction method. In the end of the project I noticed, that both Raycast methods and the \textit{Wand Grab} work after the same rules, so I combined them in one script. If I had done that earlier I could have avoided a lot of trouble for me and Anna Bolder as we needed to integrate them in to all scenes, separately first. \\
But all in all the workflow was well structured, as anyone had her own work area. Whenever this areas collides (for example the integration of the interactions into our scenes), we managed that both responsible people worked together on this task.
