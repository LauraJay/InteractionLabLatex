\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:Conclusion}


The project progress went well with focus on a working application and without bigger complications. These were directly discussed and solved by the team. Each team member make one's contribution in nearly equal percentages. Hence, the result is a working application for the evaluation of grabbing interaction methods with the \textit{HTC Vive} controllers. Most of the project goals were achieved beside the missing HMD Raycast and Gogo interaction method, the reduction of user tasks and the missing extensibility. Nevertheless, it has to mentioned that there is still a potential for improvement like the visible ray on transparent surfaces or the objects that sometimes fall through the ground.
